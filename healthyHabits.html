          <p class="healthy-paragraphs"> Organic food reduces health risks by minimizing their exposure to toxic and chemicals on the farm and in food. Children are especially vulnerable to pesticides. 
      Pesticide residues in organically grown fruits, vegetables and grains when compared to conventionally grown food. 
        One research shows that organic food that are grown organically are rich in nutrients, such as Vitamin C, iron, magnesium and phosphorus.</p>
        
    <h2 class="healthy-headers"> More healthy fats </h2>

          <p class="healthy-paragraphs"> When it comes to meat and milk, organic
        products can have 50% more heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids compared to conventionally produced products, according 
        to 1 2016 study in the British Journal of Nutrition. Organic milk tested in the study also had less saturated fat than non-organic. Switching from conventional 
        to organic products would raise consumers' omega 3 intake without increasing overallcalories or saturated fat.</p>
    


     <h2 class="healthy-headers">No antibiotics or synthetic hormones</h2>
          <p class="healthy-paragraphs">Conventional livestock can be fed antibiotics to protect against illness, thus, animals can be raised in crowded or unsanitary conditions. organic food is produced without
       antibiotics. With the exception of poultry, conventional livestock can be injected with synthetic growth hormones, so they will gain weight faster or produce more milk.
       Organic meat and dairy also cannot contain synthetic hormones, which have been linked to an increased risk of cancer. </p>

       <h2 class="healthy-headers">More antioxidants</h2>
          <p class="healthy-paragraphs">In a recent six year study in the Journal of Agriculture and Food chemistry, researchers found that organic onions had about a 20% higher antioxidant content than 
  conventionally grown onions. Another research shows that organic soybeans have a healthier nutritional profile than conventionally grown soybeans.  </p>
