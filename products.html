      <h1 class ="Title" style="color: rgb(46, 75, 2); font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">At Farmigo our research shows</h1>

      <p style="font-size: 30px; font-style: italic; ">The long-term goal of developing sustainable food systems is considered a high priority by several intergovernmental organizations. Different agricultural management systems may have an impact on the sustainability of food systems, as they may affect human health as well as animal wellbeing, food security and environmental sustainability.</p>
</div>



<div class="Effects">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;color: teal;">This review details the science on the effects of organic food and organic food production on human health and includes </h2>
</div>
  

<div class="order">
      <ol style="font-size: 30px; color: indigo;">
          <li>studies that directly address such effects in epidemiological studies and clinical trials.</li>
          <li>animal and in vitro studies that evaluate biological effects of organic compared to conventional feed and food.</li>
          <li>Focusing on narrower aspects of production, we then discuss the impact of the production system on
          plant protection, pesticide exposure, and effects of pesticides on human health,</li>
          <li>plant nutrition, the composition of crops and the relevance for human health,</li>
          <LI>animal feeding regimens, effects on the composition of animal foods and the relevance for human health.
          <li>animal health and well-being, the use of antibiotics in animal production, its role in the development of antibiotic
            resistance, and consequences of antibiotic resistance for public health.</li>
      </ol>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;font-style: oblique;">
          singular food safety events such as outbreaks of diseases that are not clearly caused by the production system (hygiene regulations for plant production and for animal slaughtering and processing are for the most part identical for organic and conventional agriculture) or fraudulent introduction of contaminated feed into the feed market

          
          historic events and historic sources of exposure, such as the BSE crisis caused by the now-banned practice of feeding cattle with meat and bone meal from cattle, or continuing effects of the historic use of DDT, now banned in all agricultural contexts globally</li>


          
          contaminants from food packaging


          aspects of food processing, such as food additives


          
          the presence of mycotoxins in consequence of post-harvest storage and processing which is governed chiefly by moisture and temperature in storage


          
          the use of growth hormones in animal production, which is not permitted in the EU but in several other countries

<div class="children">
    <p style="font-size: 30px; font-style: italic;">We all want the best for our children – especially when it comes to establishing a nutritious diet. We always strive to make informed decisions when it comes to our children’s health, but there’s one thing we can’t ever seem to agree on: organic or non-organic? </p>
</div>


<div class="Paragraph">
    <p style="font-size: 30px; font-style: italic;">While we believe that organic fruits and veggies are healthier (and thus only wants to feed our children organic produce), We are content with giving them conventional fruits and vegetables as long as they’re washed and scrubbed thoroughly under running water. This is a false statement.  In our opinion, non-organic produce is not as healthy as the option for organic.</p>
</div>


<div class="Better">
<p style="font-size: 40px; color: lightcoral; text-align: center;">Is organic better?</p>


<h1 style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center; font-style: oblique;color: rgb(112, 12, 96);">As we see it. Yes, here at Farmigo. We’re here to prove that.</h1>
