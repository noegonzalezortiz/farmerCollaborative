                  <p>The long-term goal of developing sustainable food systems is considered a high priority by several
                        intergovernmental organizations. Different agricultural management systems may have an impact on
                        the
                        sustainability of food systems, as they may affect human health as well as animal wellbeing,
                        foodsecurity and environmental sustainability.</p>

                        production system (hygiene regulations for plant production and for animal slaughtering and
                        processing
                        are for the most part identical for organic and conventional agriculture) or fraudulent

                        as the
                        BSE crisis caused by the now-banned practice of feeding cattle with meat and bone meal from
                        cattle, or
                        continuing effects of the historic use of DDT, now banned in all agricultural contexts globally

                        the presence of mycotoxins in consequence of post-harvest storage and processing which is
                        governed

                        which

                  <p>We all want the best for our children – especially when it comes to establishing a nutritious diet.
                        We
                        always strive to make informed decisions when it comes to our children’s health, but there’s one
                        thing
                        we can’t ever seem to agree on: organic or non-organic? </p>


                  <p>While we believe that organic fruits and veggies are healthier (and thus only wants to feed our
                        children
                        organic produce), We are content with giving them conventional fruits and vegetables as long as
                        they’re washed and scrubbed thoroughly under running water. This is a false statement. In our
                        opinion,
                        non-organic produce is not as healthy as the option for organic.</p>


                  <p>Is organic better?</p>
