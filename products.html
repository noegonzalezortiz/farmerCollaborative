      <p style="font-size: 30px; font-style: italic; ">The long-term goal of developing sustainable food systems is considered a high priority by several intergovernmental organizations. Different agricultural management systems may have an impact on the sustainability of food systems, as they may affect human health as well as animal wellbeing, food security and environmental sustainability.</p>

<div class="orderone">
      <ol style="font-size: 30px; color: indigo;">
          <li>studies that directly address such effects in epidemiological studies and clinical trials.</li>
          <li>animal and in vitro studies that evaluate biological effects of organic compared to conventional feed and food.</li>
          <li>Focusing on narrower aspects of production, we then discuss the impact of the production system on
          plant protection, pesticide exposure, and effects of pesticides on human health,</li>
          <li>plant nutrition, the composition of crops and the relevance for human health,</li>
          <LI>animal feeding regimens, effects on the composition of animal foods and the relevance for human health.
          <li>animal health and well-being, the use of antibiotics in animal production, its role in the development of antibiotic

<div class="children">
    <p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic;">We all want the best for our children – especially when it comes to establishing a nutritious diet. We always strive to make informed decisions when it comes to our children’s health, but there’s one thing we can’t ever seem to agree on: organic or non-organic? </p>
</div>


<div class="Paragraph">
    <p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic;">While we believe that organic fruits and veggies are healthier (and thus only wants to feed our children organic produce), We are content with giving them conventional fruits and vegetables as long as they’re washed and scrubbed thoroughly under running water. This is a false statement.  In our opinion, non-organic produce is not as healthy as the option for organic.</p>

<div class="Better">
<p style="font-size: 40px; color: lightcoral; text-align: center;">Is organic better?</p>
