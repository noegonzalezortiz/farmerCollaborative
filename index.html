                    <p class="description">The Hudson Valley is a premier place for farmers and sustainable organic agriculture. We are lucky that over the last decade, many organizations have built programming to support organic farmers in this area.</p>  
                    <p class="description">
                    Even though we organizations share a common goal, sometimes we duplicate each othersâ€™ work, instead of build on it. Or sometimes we lack the resources or the mandate to ask the really big questions; instead staying focused on what we know we can accomplish on our own. And too often we simply stay siloed, which keeps us from the more creative ideas, equitable solutions and lasting results that would come from collaboration.</p> 
                    <p class="description"> 
                    But true collaboration is hard: it takes time, resources and commitment. In recognition of that, several organizations and farmers in the Hudson Valley are launching a project to build this Hudson Valley Farmer Collaborative (Farmigo) so that our partners in the Hudson Valley can find a link between producers and consumers.
